Worked on the computer class, put in the attributes for the init in computer.py
Added functions to computer.py: update_price, refurbish
Added functions to resale shop: print_inventory, sell
Went to TA hours to figure out how to call the computer class and also to try to figure out how to commit stuff on github (unfortunately the TA didn't know)

Got COVID oops. Finished attributes and added some comments.

This was pretty scary at first because it was a lot of code and I didn't know how it worked. I think it's easier to write something from scratch that I know how it works than to try to edit someone else's code that I didn't make. Going to TA hours helped and to someone taking this course in the future: I would recommend taking the time to just sit and read through this code and try to comprehend it before jumping in with edits. Also be thoughtful with which files you put different functions in.
